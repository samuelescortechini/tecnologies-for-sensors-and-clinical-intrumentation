## 🧠 Presentation Overview

The PowerPoint slides summarize the key aspects of the project, including:

- Introduction to **Positron Emission Tomography (PET)**
- Use of **Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations** for PET detector design
- Two anatomical scenarios:
  - **Head phantom** (brain and skull)
  - **Thorax phantom** (heart, lungs, rib cage)
- Comparison of:
  - **Detector materials** (BGO, LYSO, LSO, LFS)
  - **Detector geometries** (crystal width, number of rings/crystals)
  - **Source positions** and their impact on dose distribution
- Results in terms of **efficiency**, **dose absorption**, and **design trade-offs**
- Conclusions and **future development directions**
